# Recap progress & next steps 

1. Storyboard/Design team (Becky, Pam, Tony B?, Paul? ... maybe Stephen is interested in joining this group?)

   The Design team will draft some "Phase I" plain-language text that can be used on our existing website to frame the data visualizations (see descriptions below).  Becky will transcribe the groups notes/outlines and share. The team will work with the MB Website Team to plan for adding the content to our existing website.

2. Data visualization/Technical team (Nate, Rob, Emily, Derek, Theo, Kathy? ... maybe Bob is interested in joining this group?)

   We identified 3 visualizations to focus on for Phase I:

  * A state-level map with mouse over or click by state to show avg total ducks/hunter, avg total geese/hunter (or all waterfowl?), avg days/hunter + possibly distribution of birds/hunter or percentiles of distribution or birds v. days or other more detailed statistics. Uses Hunter Diary Survey. [Info provided: how does my effort and success compare to others in my state?]

  * A state-level, zoom in to state/region map with species selection (all, 1, or selected set) showing total harvest color coded to state (no zoom) or county (zoom/state click) .... I suggest these should be color coded by percentile (top 5%, top 10%) and not abundance, as that will make the graphs more uniform across species and seem like a more relevant summary statistic than "total harvest" which is a bit obscure ... Uses: PCS data [Info provided: where to go to hunt selected species, "best state for"]

  * Still TBD graphics of harvest as a function of date in season.  Could be distribution curves for regions or states, or summary of median harvest date by state. Could be animated county maps with running "total harvest" and temporal "slide bar" on bottom of map.  Issue: being careful to summarize correctly to account for annual variation, small samples, changes over time; indicate uncertainty in visualizations and in text. Uses: PCS data ... can we also borrow information from hunter survey data?  [Info: when is the best time to hunt where and how has hunt timing been changing?]

The technical team is planning to meet Thursdays 12:30-2:30 in the Merriam conference room to continue to make progress on the visualizations.  Everyone is welcome to attend!
