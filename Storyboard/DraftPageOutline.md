**What do we learn from our harvest surveys?**

The diary surveys tell us how many people hunted ducks (or geese, or doves, or woodcock, etc.) in each state, how many days they hunted, when and where they hunted, and how many birds they harvested each year. We have conducted these surveys for many years, incuding years with short hunting seasons, long seasons, various daily bag limits, and a range of season dates. Based on harvest survey results from previous years, we can predict quite accurately what the harvest will be for a specific season length and daily bag limit. So, the information that hunters provide when they participate in our harvest surveys helps us set annual hunting regulations that minimize the risk of over-harvesting these birds, but it also helps the USFWS and state wildlife agencies provide the most, and hopefully the best, hunting opportunity possible each year.

>*How do we know the total number of duck (or dove, or woodcock) hunters in a state?* [Click to bring up box with short explanation of HIP] Hunters are required to register for the Harvest Information Program (HIP) in each state they hunt migratory game birds. Methods of HIP registration vary from state to state - some states require a separate permit, others offer free HIP registration over the internet, etc. - so before you hunt migratory bird be sure you know what the state requires, especially if you hunt in a state where you're a nonresident. When you register for HIP you're asked about how many of certain kinds of birds you harvested the previous year - this helps us make sure we send most of our dove surveys, for example, to people who usually hunt doves, rather than to waterfowl hunters. The states send their HIP registration information to the USFWS as they collect it before and during the hunting season, and the USFWS selects a sample of those hunters and sends them diary surveys. The estimates of total hunters are based on a combination of the total number of HIP registrations in a state and responses to the diary survey from a fairly small sample of total HIP registrants. For example, if a state has 100,000 HIP registrants and 50% of the hunters who respond to the diary survey for dove hunting in that state report that they hunted doves, the estimate of dove hunters for the state is 50% of total HIP registrants, or 50,000 hunters. The actual calculations are more complicated, but that's the gist of it.


This information is used by states to … and by the USFWS to estimate total harvest:

This information is used by states to … and by the USFWS and our partners to protect and improve critical wetland habitats.

Because the survey asks about daily totals, we learn when hunting happens:

This information helps the states know when to allow hunting. It also guides habitat managers by providing information on when and where to alter water levels and ….
