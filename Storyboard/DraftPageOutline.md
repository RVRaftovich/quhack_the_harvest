**What do we learn from our harvest surveys?**

The diary surveys tell us how many people hunted ducks (or geese, or doves, or woodcock, etc.) in each state, how many days they hunted, when and where they hunted, and how many birds they harvested each year. We have conducted these surveys for many years, including years with short hunting seasons, long seasons, various daily bag limits, and a range of season dates. Based on harvest survey results from previous years, we can predict quite accurately what the harvest will be for a specific season length and daily bag limit. So, the information that hunters provide when they participate in our harvest surveys helps us set annual hunting regulations that minimize the risk of over-harvesting these birds, but it also helps the USFWS and state wildlife agencies provide the most, and hopefully the best, hunting opportunity possible each year.

>*How do we know the total number of waterfowl (or dove, or woodcock) hunters in a state?* [Click to bring up box with short explanation of HIP] Hunters are required to register for the Harvest Information Program (HIP) in each state they hunt migratory game birds. Methods of HIP registration vary from state to state - some states require a separate permit, others offer free HIP registration over the internet, etc. - so before you hunt migratory birds, be sure you know what the state requires, especially if you're a nonresident. When you register for HIP you're asked about how many of certain kinds of birds you harvested the previous year - this helps us make sure we send most of our dove surveys, for example, to people who usually hunt doves, rather than to waterfowl hunters. The states send their HIP registration information to the USFWS as they collect it before and during the hunting season, and the USFWS selects a sample of those hunters and sends them diary surveys. The estimates of total hunters are based on a combination of the total number of HIP registrations in a state and responses to the diary survey from a fairly small sample of total HIP registrants. For example, if a state has 100,000 HIP registrants and 50% of the hunters who respond to the diary survey for dove hunting in that state report that they hunted doves, the estimate of dove hunters for the state is 50% of total HIP registrants, or 50,000 hunters. The actual calculations are more complicated, but that's the gist of it.

Once we know how many hunters there are in each state, we rely on what people tell us in the diary surveys to estimate hunting effort and total harvest. Using ducks as an example, we multiply the average number of days people reported hunting ducks on their waterfowl hunting diaries and multiply that average by the number of duck hunters, and that gives us estimates of the total number of days people hunted ducks. Same thing for harvest - average number of ducks shot, as reported on the diary surveys, times number of duck hunters gives us estimates of the number of ducks shot in each state.

The diary surveys provide two other important pieces of information - when and where birds are harvested throughout the hunting season. Although the USFWS decides the season length every year, each of the state wildlife agencies choose the hunting season dates in their state. They try to select the dates that will be most likely to provide the best hunting. Diary survey participants tell us the exact dates they hunted and how many birds they harvested on each of those dates. So, a state agency can look at the total number of birds shot on each date for the past, say, 10 years, to figure out when the most birds are usually harvested in their state, and set their season to cover those dates.

Information about where the most birds are harvested is also important. Duck harvest is only high in areas where there are lots of ducks, and that's because those areas have good duck habitat. So, the harvest survey can help the USFWS, state wildlife agencies, and other partners decide where they should use their resources to protect, maintain, and/or improve critical wetland habitats for waterfowl.

We mentioned earlier that the date information hunters give us on the diary surveys can be useful for setting hunting season dates. The Waterfowl Parts Survey also asks hunters for date information, so results of that survey give states the option of further refining their season date selection process. For example, if most hunters in a state prefer to shoot mallards, the survey results can be used to show when the most mallards are shot in that state.

The "when and where" information from the Waterfowl Parts Survey could also be useful to some hunters. Let's say you just moved to a new state and you don't know anyone there - where should you look for a place to hunt mallards (or pintails, etc.)? The survey information might be a good place to start. Or, let's say you want to take a trip to the East and shoot a black duck and a common eider, hopefully during the same hunt or at least in the same place. Whether you want to hire a guide or go on a do-it-yourself hunt, the "when and where" harvest information for those species would help you figure out what areas and dates to consider for your trip. What about if you want to try for an Atlantic brant while you're at it? You could use the species harvest by date and county to see if that's a possibility. We're working on making that kind of information more readily available to hunters.
