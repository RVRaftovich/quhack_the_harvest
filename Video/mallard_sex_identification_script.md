_[Photo of mallard drake(s) and hen(s).]_

It’s easy to tell the sex of a mallard in November or December, when the birds are wearing their breeding plumage.  Greenheads are drakes, and the brown mallards are hens.  But many of the drakes, especially the young-of-the-year ones, haven’t colored up yet in late September and early October, and that’s when duck hunting seasons open in a lot of the northern states.  It’s harder to tell one of those drakes from a hen, even after you’ve bagged one and have it in hand.  A reliable way to do that is to look at the wing plumage.

_[4 wings on white background.]_

Here are 4 mallard wings that I’ll use as examples.  The 2 on the right are from drakes and the 2 on the left are from hens.  First thing to notice is that the male wings look grayish overall, and the female wings look more brownish.  That’s fine when you have several you can compare, but it’s hard to tell brownish gray from grayish brown when you’re only looking at one bird’s wings.  Let’s look more closely at the key feature that differentiates males from females.

-[Adult male wing.]_

First let’s quickly go through the names of the key feather groups.  The primaries are the main flight feathers, the secondary feathers are the ones that are mostly an iridescent blue color, and the tertials are the longer feathers that are closest to the body.  Notice on this male wing that there’s a broad white bar above the blue secondary feathers, but the white bar does not extend over the tertial feathers.  That’s a distinctive male characteristic.

_[Other adult male wing.]_

Once in a while you’ll see a male wing with a little bit of white at the tip of one or 2 of the feathers above the tertials, but it doesn’t look like an extension of the white bar.

_[Adult female wing.]_

On a female wing, though, the ends of the feathers above the tertials are white, so that white bar over the secondary feathers extends over the tertial feathers too.  It’s really distinctive on this adult female wing.

_[Both wings together.]_

The difference between male and female is obvious when you compare these 2.  Sometimes it’s not as easy, especially when you have a young-of-the-year bird.

_[Immature female wing.]_

This is a wing from a young-of-the-year female.  The wing feathers on immature ducks aren’t as strong as an adult’s wing feathers, so they often show quite a bit of wear and tear.  The ends of the feathers over the tertials on this wing are pretty worn, so some of that white tip has worn off.  But you can still see that the overall appearance is of a white bar that extends across the tertial feathers.
Walt’s banding photo of immature male.
Here’s a photograph of a young-of-the-year mallard that was captured and banded in mid or late August.  A month or so later, on opening day of duck season in the north, it probably didn’t look much different than this.  Bigger, but its colors likely weren’t much different.  But even though it’s a brown duck, you can easily tell from its wing that it’s a male because the wing is grayish and the white bar doesn’t extend over the tertial feathers.
